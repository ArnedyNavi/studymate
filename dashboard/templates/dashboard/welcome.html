            <p class="text-animate animate-right">In the year of 2020 and 2021 we experienced that digital learning is as important as learning in class. Most knowledge and information that students gather these days are from the internet, such as searching for open courses and finding learning materials. But sometimes searching for a course or learning materials can be confusing especially for people who just started to learn something new and doesn't know whom to ask. Thus Studymate is created to solve this problem in a community based learning experience. Studymate provides learning materials and recommended courses based on what the community had experienced, so the user can choose their own learning materials based on what other say about a certain learning material or course.</p>
