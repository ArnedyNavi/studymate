### About the Project
Studymate is a web application designed to help students and learners in their studying journey. Studymate is built to establish an ease of access to different types of necessity when learning or discovering new things. Our goal is to create the perfect virtual studying environment so that students can focus more on their studies. Our platform is a community based system where the community will decide the workflow of this web application.

#### Our Vision
We envision a world where anyone, anywhere has the power to transform their life through learning.

#### Our Mission
We believe that learning is crucial for human development. But, sometimes the process of learning is not easy. There are many people that have limited or even no access to education. Some people have, but sometimes they don't have access to additional material. Our commitement is to ensure that students can learn from anyone, anywhere and to make the process of learning to be fun. We are here to ensure that everyone has their own studymate
